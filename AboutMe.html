      <ol>
        <li> You'll need to learn many contraptions by yourself, for example, I learned to make "Break the Wall" 
           by myself, but of course I'll show you how to make the contraptions I had to make</li>
        <li> Be familiar with coding, since based on 1, you may need to figure stuff out by yourself, and that
           includes scripting</li>
        <li> Make sure to change your series subject and switch out of the Classic Marble Race Track
           quick, or otherwise the audience might get bored</li>
